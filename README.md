# branch_prediction_simulator
It simulates a simple branch predictor with a 2-bit saturating counter. You are provided with a text file containing a trace of branch instructions consisting of the PC at which each branch occurs, and whether the branch is Taken or Not Taken. 
Your goal is write code to evaluate the performance of a 2-bit saturating counter based branch predictor on this trace. Your output file indicates, for each branch in the trace, whether it was predicted as Taken or Not Taken.
